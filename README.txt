a second internship repo has hit the github page 

The goal of this repo is to implement 
a TASEP based model of entities moving on a city graph. 

To make things more interresting, I'll then make perturbations 
on the graph by breaking links during the simulation. 
I'll then study how it impacts the simulations. 


Once this is done I'll make it interact with the walking_on_graphs project in order
to create perturbation on the graph based on where the WOG walkers are.
I'll then study these perturbations and so on
