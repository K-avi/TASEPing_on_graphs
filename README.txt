sir a second internship repo has hit the github page 

The goal of it's repo is to use the time left in my internship (and my spare time) to implement 
a TASEP based model of stuff moving on city graph. 

Once this is doen I'll make it interact with the walking_on_graphs project in order to create perturbation on the graph 
based on where the WOG walkers are. I'll then study these perturbations and so on
