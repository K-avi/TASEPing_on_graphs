redesign of code structure count : 0 

done : 

   - graph implem (reused the one of wog )

   - implemented entities 

   - count how many guys move 

   - implemented attack structure 

   - implemented movement structure 

   - attack function thing to update closed links

   - implemented the load attack function ; the program can now be 
     tested yay! 

    implement the main 

   - add a lil helper thing that takes the nb of it and the nb of attacks and divide and inits the 
     array w the index of the attack start this way 


pending : 

C : 

   - test the program ffs


Python : 

   - make script that turns the wog format of graph to the one I want and maps the wog links to these to make the attack function thing 
      (hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm)
   - make script that produces random attack function 


Misc : 

   - docs
   - gpl 
   - cursewords

this sounds easier than WOG tbh
